<h1>Welcome!</h1>

My name is Gerard, and this is my attempt at a personal website!

Here you can find a summary of some aspects of my life. From my education, to more of my education, and beyond. Thank you for wanting to get to know me!

Some of my favourite quotes:

<i>"What the heck are adiabatic tubes doing in a heat exchanger???" - My favourite prof</i>

<i>"Some models are kaechosan, but some are umeepek, eme" - Anonymous</i>
